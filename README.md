# discord_bot_py

### Discord bot that I made for my own server

This bot has various features that, through their implementation,
allowed me to learn the python syntax as well as working with different
programming concepts, APIs, and data storage like sqlite / text files.

##### Things I have learned so far:
 1. **Python**
 - refreshed OOP concepts
 - created custom classes (look [dataMerger.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/dataMerger.py), [fonts.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/fonts.py), [wikiChemObj.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/wikiChemObj.py))
 - unusual functions like translate() for mapping (look [fonts.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/fonts.py))
 - async and await logic (look [bot.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/bot.py))
 - use of decorators (look **@sqlConn** in [database_test.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/database_test.py))
 2. **General Concepts**
 - web scraping (look [scraper.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/scraper.py))
 - APIs (wolfram, chemicals library - look [scraper.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/scraper.py))
 - database - local sqlite (look [database_test.py](https://github.com/ston3dg3/discord_bot_py/blob/staging/database_test.py))
 - project file organisation (look project structure)
 - use of git and github for source control (look here)
 - serializing data for database storage (had to store python object in the local sqlite db) - using pickles python library
